# これなに

約7ヶ月振りに Flutter アプリを iOS Simulator で起動しようとしたら以下のエラーが大量に出た。
その時の解決方法をメモします。
なお、この記事は自分が解決した時のメモであり、同様の事象が発生した方々全てで解決できるかどうかは保証していません。

```zsh
    flutter run --debug --device-id 7266AD1A-89DD-471F-886D-CF3C643D33B2
    ...
    /myapp/ios/Pods/Pods.xcodeproj: warning: The iOS
    Simulator deployment target 'IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET' is set to 10.0, but the range of
    supported deployment target versions is 12.0 to 18.5.99. (in target
    'gRPC-C++-gRPCCertificates-Cpp' from project 'Pods')
```

# 原因

- Pod に記載があるデプロイメントターゲットとプロジェクトデプロイメントターゲットが異なっていることが原因のようでした。
- しかし、修正箇所はかなり多く、一つひとつを手作業で修正するのは時間がかかる模様です。

# 解決方法

### 修正概要

[こちらの Stackflow の記事](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54704207/the-ios-simulator-deployment-targets-is-set-to-7-0-but-the-range-of-supported-d)を参考にしましたが、要するに以下のことを実施すれば良いとのこと


- 指定の iOS バージョンを強制指定するようにコードを書き換える（上記エラーで言うと iOS 12 を強制指定する
- cocoapods を再インストール（こちらは念のための作業）

### コード修正内容

- 上記 Stackflow にも記載がありましたが、 `ios/Podfile` で `config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '12.0'` を直接指定することで修正できました
- また、デプロイ先の同一IDのデバイスが複数あるという警告メッセージがあったので、それを除外するように `config.build_settings['EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]'] = 'i386'` を加えています
- その他にも、gRPCコンパイルエラーがあったのでそちらも修正を行っています
- 詳細のエラーログは本記事の付録セクションに記載しました

      # Global C++ settings to fix gRPC compilation issues

# さいごに

新しい MacBook に端末を買い替えてからの初めてのデプロイをしたら上記のようなエラーになってしまいました…
実際には元々の端末で何かしら config ファイルがあって正常に動作していたのかもしれないのですが、一旦こちらで解決できたようなのでよかったです。
